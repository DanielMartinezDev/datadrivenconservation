    <h3>In my master's thesis, I am trying to uncover the main global 
      predictors of bird phylogenetic diversity at the regional scale. 
      For this, I am using a global dataset of bird occurrences, 
      a phylogeny of all extant birds, and environmental 
      data at the regional scale. Preliminary results show that mean 
      annual temperature is the best predictor of high bird phylogenetic 
      diversity in every biogeographic realm. In addition, low mean altitude, 
      high net primary productivity, and high land-use diversity also have positive effects on phylogenetic 
      diversity, mostly mediated by species richness. My study highlights the importance of understanding environmental 
      factors in shaping bird phylogenetic biodiversity worldwide and the potential effect of climate change 
      on re-estructuring bird assemblages. <a href="mailto:pbarriosnoya@gmail.com">Click here to contact me.</a></h3>

    <h3>My PhD thesis aims to explore how the interplay between landscape context
       and agricultural practices shapes pollinator communities through an interaction
        network approach in the olive grove landscapes of Andalusia (southern Spain).
         I hope my research will generate knowledge to design more effective actions
         for the restoration and conservation of pollinators in agricultural landscapes.
          I am very interested in entomology, specifically in the ecology and taxonomy
           of pollinating insects. <a href="mailto:dcano@ujaen.es">Click here to contact me.</a></h3>

    <h3>In my master's thesis, I am studying the impact of agricultural intensification on
       pollinators functional diversity and trait filtering (weighted mean traits, such as
        body size, relative tongue size, and relative wing size). For this, we focus on wild
         bees on olive farms, a very important permanent crop for the economy and biodiversity,
          covering extensive areas in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. Preliminary
           results reveal that local factors, such as the quality of flower patches, related
            to the management practices on the field can impact the richness of bees as well
             as their functional traits. Specifically, average bee body size was positively
              correlated with herb and flower cover. Similarly, wing size was positively correlated
               with herb coverage. Tongue length was negatively correlated with herb richness
                and flower coverage. Also, the taxonomic richness of bees increased with herb
                 richness and flower coverage. <a href="mailto:mpazmedale@gmail.com ">Click here to contact me.</a></h3>

    <h3>Key part of the team. In addition to my ecological endeavours, I am fortunate to have
       the support of my lovely partner Rocío and our delightful lab companion, Emilia. They
        play an integral role in both my personal life and my journey as an ecologist. Emilia,
         with her playful spirit and boundless energy, brings a wagging tail and a touch of joy
          to the lab. Exploring the great outdoors alongside Carlos and sniffing out interesting
           scents are some of her specialties.</h3>
