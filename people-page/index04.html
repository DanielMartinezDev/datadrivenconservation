    <h3>In my master's thesis, I am trying to uncover the main global
      predictors of bird phylogenetic diversity at the regional scale.
      For this, I am using a global dataset of bird occurrences,
      a phylogeny of all extant birds, and environmental
      data at the regional scale. Preliminary results show that mean
      annual temperature is the best predictor of high bird phylogenetic
      diversity in every biogeographic realm. In addition, low mean altitude,
      high net primary productivity, and high land-use diversity also have positive effects on phylogenetic
      diversity, mostly mediated by species richness. My study highlights the importance of understanding environmental
      factors in shaping bird phylogenetic biodiversity worldwide and the potential effect of climate change
      on re-estructuring bird assemblages. <a href="mailto:pbarriosnoya@gmail.com">Click here to contact me.</a></h3>

    <h3>My PhD thesis aims to explore how the interplay between landscape context
      and agricultural practices shapes pollinator communities through an interaction
      network approach in the olive grove landscapes of Andalusia (southern Spain).
      I hope my research will generate knowledge to design more effective actions
      for the restoration and conservation of pollinators in agricultural landscapes.
      I am very interested in entomology, specifically in the ecology and taxonomy
      of pollinating insects. <a href="mailto:dcano@ujaen.es">Click here to contact me.</a></h3>

    <h3>In my master's thesis, I am studying the impact of agricultural intensification on
      pollinators functional diversity and trait filtering (weighted mean traits, such as
      body size, relative tongue size, and relative wing size). For this, we focus on wild
      bees on olive farms, a very important permanent crop for the economy and biodiversity,
      covering extensive areas in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. Preliminary
      results reveal that local factors, such as the quality of flower patches, related
      to the management practices on the field can impact the richness of bees as well
      as their functional traits. Specifically, average bee body size was positively
      correlated with herb and flower cover. Similarly, wing size was positively correlated
      with herb coverage. Tongue length was negatively correlated with herb richness
      and flower coverage. Also, the taxonomic richness of bees increased with herb
      richness and flower coverage. <a href="mailto:mpazmedale@gmail.com ">Click here to contact me.</a></h3>

    <h3>My main goal is to make a better world through science. I am interested in a variety
      of research topics, all of which are closely related to community ecology and biodiversity
      conservation. My main research line seeks to gain a deeper understanding of how we can

    <h3>Key part of the team. In addition to my ecological endeavours, I am fortunate to have
      the support of my lovely partner Rocío and our delightful lab companion, Emilia. They
      play an integral role in both my personal life and my journey as an ecologist. Emilia,
      with her playful spirit and boundless energy, brings a wagging tail and a touch of joy
      to the lab. Exploring the great outdoors alongside me and sniffing out interesting
      scents are some of her specialties.</h3>
